Rather, the producer should try to adjust the new procedure so that its values are clinically indistinguishable from the old. Failing that, one should create a new observation ID for the observation produced under the new procedure.

In the rare circumstances when a procedure change occurs and neither of the above two options is viable, this field shall be used to transmit the effective date/time of the new procedure. The receiving system shall assume that any values that come across under this observation ID are under the new procedure after this date and take appropriate steps to distinguish the old from the new observations.

These distinctions are used in IUPAC and LOINC standard codes.  Defined categories are listed in HL7 Table 0254 - Kind of Quantity.

The distinctions of true quantities in this table are based primarily on dimensional analyses. The table contains a number of ""families,"" those related to simple counts (number, number concentration, etc.), to mass (mass, mass concentration, etc.), to enzyme activity (catalytic content, catalytic concentration, etc.), and molar or equivalents (substance content, substance concentration).  

By this classification, a glucose (in the US) would be classed as a mass concentration.  A sodium would be classed as a substance concentration. Within the family, a total amount should be described as the unadorned variant; e.g., the property of measure for a patient's weight would be mass, not mass content.  Most chemical measures produce concentrations, as exemplified by sodium and glucose. However, a 24-hour urine protein is not a mass concentration, but a mass rate (mass per unit time).  The content variants (e.g., mass content, substance content) are used to reflect an amount per mass (usually) of tissue.

This attribute would be valued in a master file only if the service sending the master file classified observations by their principle of measurement.",

To construct this text string, use the following template.  (Note:  This field is not constructed of formally defined components; it is a free text field.  Component delimiters are not used and it is not necessary to supply placeholders if some ""components"" are not used.)

The time delay follows the syntax: n<S|M|H|D|W> where n is a number (possibly a decimal); S denotes seconds; M denotes minutes; H denotes hours; D denotes days; and W denotes weeks.  The time delay can be preceded by a 'greater than' (>) sign, e.g. >4H.
HL7 Table 0256 - Time Delay Post Challenge lists possible values for time delay.

Examples:
PRE 100 GM GLUCOSE PO
PRE 100 GM GLUCOSE PO
30M POST 100 GM GLUCOSE PO
2H POST 100 GM GLUCOSE PO
TROUGH

For drug peak and trough measures the nature of the substance challenged is the same as the analyte name, and need not be included. 
We denote the route of the challenge via abbreviations for medication routes (see Chapter 4, section 4.14.2.1, ""Route,"" HL7 Table 0162 - Route of Administration).  An oral route of administration would be denoted by ""PO,"" an intravenous route by ""IV."" 

Details of the drug dose, time the dose was given, route of administration, etc., would be noted in separate OBX, and would have corresponding master observation definitions stored in the observation master file map to different records stored in the master file segments contained in the drug level message.

The nature of a physiologic (non-drug) challenge may also be specified, using the terms in HL7 Table 0257 - Nature of challenge.",

An observation may have as many names/codes as are applicable (e.g., ICD9, ACR-NEMA, SNOMED, and READ).

We strongly suggest that observation producers never use the same observation ID when the measurement procedures change in such a way that results produced under the new procedure are clinically different from those produced with the old procedure. Rather, the producer should try to adjust the new procedure so that its values are clinically indistinguishable from the old. Failing that, one should create a new observation ID for the observation produced under the new procedure.

In the rare circumstances when a procedure change occurs and neither of the above two options is viable, this field shall be used to transmit the effective date/time of the new procedure. The receiving system shall assume that any values that come across under this observation ID are under the new procedure after this date and take appropriate steps to distinguish the old from the new observations.

This number is included to provide a means of communicating with the observation producing service when they have questions about particular observations or results.",

This attribute distinguishes concentrations from total amounts, molar concentrations from mass concentrations, partial pressures from colors, and so forth.  These are discussed more fully in the LOINC Users' Manual.   They are derived from the approach described in 1995 edition of the IUPAC Silver Book.  These distinctions are used in IUPAC and LOINC standard codes.  Defined categories are listed in HL7 Table 0254 - Kind of Quantity.

The distinctions of true quantities in this table are based primarily on dimensional analyses. The table contains a number of ""families,"" those related to simple counts (number, number concentration, etc.), to mass (mass, mass concentration, etc.), to enzyme activity (catalytic content, catalytic concentration, etc.), and molar or equivalents (substance content, substance concentration).  

By this classification, a glucose (in the US) would be classed as a mass concentration.  A sodium would be classed as a substance concentration. Within the family, a total amount should be described as the unadorned variant; e.g., the property of measure for a patient's weight would be mass, not mass content.  Most chemical measures produce concentrations, as exemplified by sodium and glucose. However, a 24-hour urine protein is not a mass concentration, but a mass rate (mass per unit time).  The content variants (e.g., mass content, substance content) are used to reflect an amount per mass (usually) of tissue.

This attribute would be valued in a master file only if the service sending the master file classified observations by their principle of measurement.",

Interval measures most often apply to urine and stool specimens (e.g., 24-hour urines, 3-day stool fats).  They also apply to clinical measurements such as urine outputs, which are reported as shift totals and 24-hour totals, and event counts on physiologic monitors such as the number of PVCs on a 24-hour Holter monitor.  

This field would only be valued in a transaction if the service sending this master file message classified its observation by point versus time interval. This field is not used to record the time collection interval for a particular sample. It is used to specify a characteristic of an observation which has a defined normal range and to distinguish observations of the same kind but observed over varying periods of time.  A spot urine sodium would have PT stored in this field. A 24-hour urine sodium and a 24-hour Holter monitor would have 24H stored here.

To construct this text string, use the following template.  (Note:  This field is not constructed of formally defined components; it is a free text field.  Component delimiters are not used and it is not necessary to supply placeholders if some ""components"" are not used.)

The time delay follows the syntax: n<S|M|H|D|W> where n is a number (possibly a decimal); S denotes seconds; M denotes minutes; H denotes hours; D denotes days; and W denotes weeks.  The time delay can be preceded by a 'greater than' (>) sign, e.g. >4H.
HL7 Table 0256 - Time Delay Post Challenge lists possible values for time delay.

Examples:
PRE 100 GM GLUCOSE PO
PRE 100 GM GLUCOSE PO
30M POST 100 GM GLUCOSE PO
2H POST 100 GM GLUCOSE PO
TROUGH

For drug peak and trough measures the nature of the substance challenged is the same as the analyte name, and need not be included. 
We denote the route of the challenge via abbreviations for medication routes (see Chapter 4, section 4.14.2.1, ""Route,"" HL7 Table 0162 - Route of Administration).  An oral route of administration would be denoted by ""PO,"" an intravenous route by ""IV."" 

Details of the drug dose, time the dose was given, route of administration, etc., would be noted in separate OBX, and would have corresponding master observation definitions stored in the observation master file map to different records stored in the master file segments contained in the drug level message.

The nature of a physiologic (non-drug) challenge may also be specified, using the terms in HL7 Table 0257 - Nature of challenge.",
