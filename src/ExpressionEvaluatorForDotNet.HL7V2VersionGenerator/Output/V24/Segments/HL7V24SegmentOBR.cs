The starred (*) fields are only relevant when an observation is associated with a specimen.  These are completed by the placer when the placer obtains the specimen.  They are completed by the filler when the filler obtains the specimen.

OBR-7-observation date/time and OBR-8-observation end date/time are the physiologically relevant times.  In the case of an observation on a specimen, they represent the start and end of the specimen collector.  In the case of an observation obtained directly from a subject (e.g., BP, Chest X-ray), they represent the start and end time of the observation."; } }
